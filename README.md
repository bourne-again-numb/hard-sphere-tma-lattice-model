# hard-sphere-tma-lattice-model
Lattice model of silica polymerization in the presence of TMA modeled as hard-sphere
v6.2
ONLY NEUTRAL SILICA AND SPHERICAL TEMPLATES

MODEL 
      SILICA: ATOMIC SCALE LATTICE MODEL
      TEMPLATE: SINGLE SITE WITH (sda_size)th hard sphere repulsion

INTERACTIONS
	SN-SN: CONDENSATION REACTION ENERGY eSNSN
	SN-TAA: (sda_size+1)th NEIGHBOR ATTRACTION WITH BRIDGING OXYGEN ATOM (effectively, interactions with O)
	SI-TAA: NO INTERACTIONS INCLUDED(ASSUMED THAT NO SI IS PRESENT)
	NO TWO RING FORMATION

MONTE CARLO MOVES:
SILICA: GLAUBER DYNAMICS
		TRANSLATION ANYWHERE IN THE SYSTEM
		SWAP
		ROTATION

SDA: KAWASAKHI TYPE MOVES
     	       TRANSLATION TO NEAREST NEIGHBORS		
	
THIS CODE USES PTMC FOR SAMPLING SPACE
THIS IS THE FIRST MODEL OF A SPHERICAL TEMPLATE WITH VARIABLE SIZE
THE SIZE IS DETERMINED BY VARIABLE "sda_size", WHICH TELLS THE NUMBER OF NEAREST NEIGHBORS THAT THE SDA SHOULD OCCUPY. THE CODE THEN IMPOSES HARD SPHERE REPULSIONS AT EACH OF THESE NEIGHBORS.
